# Best Practices for Contributions
## Commit Rules
- Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/):
    - Use prefixes like `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`, `refactor:`, etc
    - Example: `feat(api): add new user authentication endpoint`
- Write clear and concise commit messages
- Make atomic commits with one logical change per commit
- Use feature branches for development and open Pull Requests for review
- Rebase or squash commits before merging to keep history clean

## Code Quality and Reviews
- Follow the project's coding style and linting rules
- Write and run tests where applicable (unit, integration)
- Peer reviews are mandatory; reviewers should check logic, style, and tests
- Address all feedback before merging

## Documentation
- Keep documentation clear, concise, and up to date
- Update documentation when code or processes change
- Follow localization standards if contributing to translations
- Use consistent formatting and terminology

## Collaboration
- Use the issue template to open clear, focused issues
- Respond thoughtfully to feedback on PRs and issues
- Communicate clearly and respectfully in all interactions

## CI/CD and Automation
- Ensure all automated tests and checks pass before merging
- Follow deployment guidelines if applicable
- Use provided scripts and automation tools to streamline workflows
